# InflationTrackr

This repository contains a prototype React Native app for tracking
historical prices of goods and services. The goal is to let users record
prices, view charts, compare inflation across locations, and visualize
trends on a map.

## Directory Structure

- `mobile/` – Example React Native project with a bottom tab navigator.
- `docs/design.md` – High‑level design of the planned features.

The code under `mobile/` is not a full application but demonstrates how
the app might be structured. See the design document for details.
